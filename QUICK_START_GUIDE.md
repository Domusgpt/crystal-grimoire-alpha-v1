## Important Files

### Configuration

flutter build web && cd build/web && python -m http.server 8000

# Check for issues
flutter analyze

## Environment Variables

No environment variables needed for frontend. Backend uses:

flutter clean
rm -rf .dart_tool
flutter pub get
flutter build web
```

flutter run -d web-server  # Run on any browser
```
