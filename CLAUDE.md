## Notes for Claude Code

### ðŸŽ¯ **Current Focus**
We're building a mystical crystal identification app with Flutter + GPT-4O. The core architecture is established, and we're now implementing the supporting services and UI screens.

### ðŸ”§ **Key Development Principles**
1. **Simplicity First** - Rely on GPT-4O's excellent vision capabilities
2. **Mystical UX** - Every interaction should feel magical
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start with core features, expand gradually
4. **Cost-Effective** - Smart caching and usage limits

### ðŸ“‹ **Immediate Next Steps**
1. Complete supporting services (cache, usage tracking, app state)
2. Build core UI screens (home, camera, results)
3. Implement camera integration with multi-angle capture
4. Create beautiful results display with spiritual guidance

### ðŸ”® **Long-term Vision**
Transform this into a comprehensive spiritual companion app with crystal guidance, meditation patterns, astrology integration, and a growing suite of mystical tools.
