# üîÆ Crystal Grimoire Backend - COMPLETE RENDER DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist
- ‚úÖ GitHub repo: `crystal-grimoire-clean` (public)
- ‚úÖ Backend file: `backend_crystal/simple_backend.py`
- ‚úÖ Dependencies: `backend_crystal/requirements_simple.txt` (only 4 packages)
- ‚úÖ Config file: `render.yaml` (already configured)

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment with EVERY Detail

### Step 1: Access Render Dashboard
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **https://dashboard.render.com**
3. Login with your GitHub account (you're already authenticated as Paul Phillips/Pallasite)

### Step 2: Create New Web Service
1. Look for the purple **"New +"** button (top right corner)
2. Click it and select **"Web Service"** from the dropdown
3. You'll see "Deploy your web service" page

### Step 3: Connect GitHub Repository
1. You'll see "Connect a repository" section
2. If you see existing repos, look for **`crystal-grimoire-clean`**
3. If not listed, click **"Configure account"** to grant Render access
4. Select the **`crystal-grimoire-clean`** repository
5. Click **"Connect"** button

### Step 4: Configure Service - EXACT VALUES

You'll now see the configuration form. Fill in these EXACT values:

#### Basic Info Section:
- **Name**: `crystal-grimoire-backend`
  - This becomes part of your URL
  - Must be unique across Render
  - Use exactly this name

- **Region**: `Oregon (US West)` 
  - Select from dropdown
  - Oregon is closest to your users
  - Best for low latency

- **Branch**: `main`
  - Should be auto-selected
  - This is your default branch

- **Root Directory**: `backend_crystal`
  - Type exactly: `backend_crystal`
  - This tells Render where your backend code is
  - Don't add slashes

- **Environment**: `Python 3`
  - Select from dropdown
  - Should auto-detect from your code
  - Don't select Docker or Node

#### Build & Deploy Section:
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements_simple.txt`
  - Copy/paste exactly as shown
  - Uses the simplified requirements file
  - Only installs 4 packages

- **Start Command**: `python simple_backend.py`
  - Copy/paste exactly as shown
  - Runs the simplified backend
  - No additional flags needed

#### Instance Type Section:
- **Plan**: `Free`
  - Select "Free" option
  - $0/month
  - Perfect for testing
  - Can upgrade later

### Step 5: Advanced Settings (OPTIONAL but Recommended)

Click **"Advanced"** button to expand more options:

#### Environment Variables:
Click **"Add Environment Variable"** and add these two:

1. First variable:
   - **Key**: `PORT`
   - **Value**: `8000`
   - This ensures consistent port binding

2. Second variable:
   - **Key**: `HOST`
   - **Value**: `0.0.0.0`
   - This allows external connections

#### Auto-Deploy:
- **Auto-Deploy**: `Yes` (should be default)
  - Automatically deploys when you push to GitHub
  - Very convenient for updates

#### Health Check Path (Leave Default):
- Render will auto-configure this
- Your app has `/health` endpoint ready

#### Docker Command (SKIP):
- Leave blank - we're using Python environment

#### Pre-Deploy Command (SKIP):
- Leave blank - not needed

### Step 6: Create Web Service
1. Review all settings one more time:
   ```
   Name: crystal-grimoire-backend
   Region: Oregon (US West)
   Branch: main
   Root Directory: backend_crystal
   Environment: Python 3
   Build Command: pip install -r requirements_simple.txt
   Start Command: python simple_backend.py
   Plan: Free
   
   Environment Variables:
   PORT=8000
   HOST=0.0.0.0
   ```

2. Click the purple **"Create Web Service"** button
3. DO NOT navigate away - watch the deployment

### Step 7: Monitor Deployment
1. You'll see "Deploying..." status
2. Build logs will appear in real-time
3. Expected log sequence:
   ```
   ==> Cloning from https://github.com/domusgpt/crystal-grimoire-clean
   ==> Checking out commit 7155061 in branch main
   ==> Detected Python version 3.11.x
   ==> Running build command 'pip install -r requirements_simple.txt'
   Collecting fastapi==0.104.1
   Collecting uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
   Collecting python-multipart==0.0.6
   Collecting httpx==0.25.2
   ...
   Successfully installed all packages
   ==> Build completed successfully!
   ==> Starting service with 'python simple_backend.py'
   INFO: Started server process
   INFO: Waiting for application startup
   INFO: Application startup complete
   INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

4. Wait for "Live" status (green indicator)
5. Total time: 3-5 minutes

### Step 8: Get Your Backend URL
1. Once deployed, look at the top of the page
2. You'll see your service URL:
   ```
   https://crystal-grimoire-backend-[random-suffix].onrender.com
   ```
3. Click the URL to open in new tab
4. COPY THIS URL - you'll need it for Flutter

### Step 9: Verify Deployment
1. Visit your backend URL in browser
2. You should see:
   ```json
   {
     "service": "CrystalGrimoire Simple API",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "status": "operational",
     "endpoints": {
       "health": "/health",
       "identify": "/api/v1/crystal/identify"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Test health endpoint by adding `/health` to your URL:
   ```
   https://crystal-grimoire-backend-xyz.onrender.com/health
   ```
   
   Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "service": "crystalgrimoire-simple",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "endpoints": ["/", "/health", "/api/v1/crystal/identify"]
   }
   ```

## üéØ What Success Looks Like

### ‚úÖ Deployment Successful When:
- Service shows "Live" status in Render dashboard
- URL responds with JSON when visited
- Health endpoint returns "healthy" status
- No error messages in logs

### üìä Render Dashboard Overview:
- **Metrics**: Shows requests, response times
- **Logs**: Real-time application logs
- **Settings**: Where you can update configuration
- **Environment**: Shows your env variables
- **Deploy**: Manual redeploy button

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Build Failed" Error:
- Check if `requirements_simple.txt` exists in `backend_crystal/`
- Verify Python version compatibility
- Look at build logs for specific error

### "Port Already in Use":
- Already handled in our code
- Uses PORT env variable or 8000

### "Module Not Found":
- Ensure Root Directory is exactly `backend_crystal`
- Check file names match exactly

### Service Crashes After Deploy:
- Check runtime logs in Render dashboard
- Verify start command is correct
- Ensure simple_backend.py is executable

### Slow Initial Response:
- Normal on free tier (cold start)
- First request takes 10-30 seconds
- Subsequent requests are fast

## üìù Post-Deployment Notes

### What Your Backend Provides:
1. **Crystal Identification API**
   - POST `/api/v1/crystal/identify`
   - Accepts multiple images
   - Returns AI-powered identification

2. **Health Monitoring**
   - GET `/health`
   - For uptime monitoring

3. **Service Info**
   - GET `/`
   - Shows API documentation

### Free Tier Limitations:
- Spins down after 15 min inactivity
- 750 hours/month runtime
- Shared CPU/RAM
- Perfect for development/demo

### Next Steps After Successful Deployment:
1. Copy your backend URL
2. Return to this Claude Code session
3. I'll update Flutter app with your URL
4. Test complete integration
5. Redeploy Flutter with backend connected

## üéâ You're Ready!

This guide covers EVERY field and option you'll see. The deployment is designed to be simple and reliable. Your backend will be live in minutes!

**Remember**: The `simple_backend.py` is specifically designed to deploy without issues. It only has 4 dependencies and includes all the crystal identification magic!
