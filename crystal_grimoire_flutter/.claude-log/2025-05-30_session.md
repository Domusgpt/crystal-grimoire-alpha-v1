## 2025-05-30 11:06:26 - Task: Fix Flutter compilation errors

### Issues Fixed:
1. **meditation_sound_bath.dart line 678**: Added missing spread operator (...) before list in children array
2. **astro_crystal_matcher.dart line 77**: Removed call to undefined _loadMoonPhaseCrystals() method  
3. **astro_crystal_matcher.dart line 402**: Fixed type casting - changed 'as double' to 'as num'
4. **astro_crystal_matcher.dart line 1547**: Added null safety handling for zodiacInfo['dates'] with 'as String? ?? ''
5. **astro_crystal_matcher.dart line 1987**: Fixed TextDirection.ltr by adding dart:ui import and using ui.TextDirection.ltr
6. **crystal_energy_healing.dart**: Fixed multiple Object to String casting issues by adding 'as String' type casts

### Files Modified:
- lib/screens/meditation_sound_bath.dart (fixed spread operator)
- lib/screens/astro_crystal_matcher.dart (fixed method call, type casting, TextDirection)  
- lib/screens/crystal_energy_healing.dart (fixed type casting issues)

### Result:
- Flutter web build now succeeds (âœ“ Built build/web)
- All critical compilation errors resolved
- Project builds successfully for web deployment

### Remaining Issues:
- Style warnings (deprecated withOpacity usage) - these are non-critical
- Performance suggestions - these don't prevent compilation

### Technical Details:
- Fixed Widget type mismatch by properly spreading lists in children arrays
- Resolved method not found errors by removing undefined method calls
- Fixed type casting issues by using proper Dart type casting syntax
- Handled nullable strings with null-aware operators
- Resolved TextDirection enum issues by using qualified imports
