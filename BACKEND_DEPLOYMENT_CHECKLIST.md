## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Get Your Backend URL
Once deployed, Render will provide a URL like:
```
https://crystal-grimoire-backend-xyz123.onrender.com
```

### 2. Test Health Endpoint
Open a new browser tab and visit:
```
https://YOUR-BACKEND-URL.onrender.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "crystalgrimoire-simple",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "endpoints": ["/", "/health", "/api/v1/crystal/identify"]
}
```

### 3. Test Crystal Identification (Optional)
You can test the API using curl or Postman:
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-BACKEND-URL.onrender.com/api/v1/crystal/identify \
  -F "images=@test_image.jpg" \
  -F "angles=front"
```

## 🔗 Next Steps After Deployment

Once your backend is deployed and verified:

1. **Copy your backend URL** from Render dashboard
2. **Update Flutter app** with the live backend URL
3. **Test end-to-end** crystal identification
4. **Redeploy Flutter** app with backend integration

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs for specific errors
2. Verify Python version compatibility
3. Ensure all files are committed to GitHub

### If API doesn't respond:
1. Wait 30 seconds (cold start on free tier)
2. Check Render dashboard for service status
3. Verify CORS settings in browser console

### Common Issues:
- **Port binding**: Already handled in simple_backend.py
- **Dependencies**: Only 4 packages, all standard
- **Memory**: Simple backend uses minimal resources

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Render dashboard logs
2. Verify all steps were followed exactly
3. The simple backend is designed to "just work"

**Remember**: This simplified backend is specifically designed for reliable deployment. It will work!
